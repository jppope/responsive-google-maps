======================

Google maps responsive with new google maps/ google maps 3.0

The simplest files to add a google map into your site. Default location is Timbuktu. Your site only needs these things to add the google map in:
1) The Javascript call to the API
2) The map canvas div for where the call will go
3) the javascript specifics about what the map is supposed to display. (you'll want to replace timbuktu)
